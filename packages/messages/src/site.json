  "intro_paragraph": "Welcome to Weird California! Throughout the rest of this site, we invite you to take the strange path through California. Inside, you won’t see the run of the mill tourist sites that this great state has to offer, but instead some of its lesser known secrets. Now the places and things described within don’t follow the normal concept of what a tourist would usually go and see as they traveled around California. No, we here at Weird CA took the strange path through California to bring you the unusual, the different, the bizarre, and the weird.\n\nVisit haunted hotels, meet unusual people, dine amongst the spirits, hear old campfire tales and peruse old historic landmarks. We hope you enjoy this and our future topics; and that you will continue to join us on the strange path."
